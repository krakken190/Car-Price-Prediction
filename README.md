# Car-Price-Prediction

1.Model Development and Evaluation: Led the creation of predictive models including Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, Stacked Ensemble Model, and Xtreme Gradient Boosting. Achieved high accuracy and precision in predicting car prices, evidenced by R-squared scores exceeding 0.95 across models.

2.Data Handling and Visualization: Spearheaded data preprocessing and exploration efforts, ensuring data integrity and identifying key insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA). Visualized dataset characteristics and trends using seaborn and matplotlib, providing actionable insights for model development.

3.Collaborative Problem-Solving: Collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop and refine machine learning models, leveraging techniques like label encoding, feature scaling, and model stacking. Communicated model performance effectively through visualizations and presentations, facilitating informed decision-making for stakeholders.
